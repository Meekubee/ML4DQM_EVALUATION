# ML4DQM_EVALUATION

This repository contains my submission for the **Evaluation Test: ML4DQM**.

## Project Overview
The project involves building and evaluating a **Vision Transformer (ViT) model** to classify images from a synthetic dataset generated at the Large Hadron Collider's (LHC) Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector. The goal is to compare the performance of a traditional ViT model with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) ViT approach.
